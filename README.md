# Synced Tabs

This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/).

It is based on the **great idea and script** [Sync Edit Views.py](https://github.com/Tosche/Glyphs-Scripts/blob/master/Sync%20Edit%20Views.py) by [Tosche](https://github.com/Tosche).

If active, it keeps all tabs from all open fonts in sync with the currently active tab. In **realtime!**

### How to use

When ever you need it, toggle `Show Synced Tabs` from the view menu or the [Roporter Toggler](https://github.com/Mark2Mark/Reporter-Toggler).
